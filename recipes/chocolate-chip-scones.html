        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>⅓ cup packed brown sugar </li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled </li>
            <li>½ cup buttermilk </li>
            <li>1 egg </li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons almond extract </li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips </li>
            <li>½ cup chopped hazelnuts </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Lightly butter a 9 inch diameter circle in the center of a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, stir together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Cut the butter into 1/2 inch cubes, and distribute evenly 
                over flour mixture. With a pastry blender or two knives, cut butter into the flour mixture. Stir together buttermilk, egg, and extract; add to the 
                flour mixture, and stir to combine. Stir in the chocolate chips and hazelnuts. The dough will be sticky.</li>
            <li>Spread the dough into an 8 inch diameter circle on the baking sheet. Cut with a serrated knife into 8 wedges.</li>
            <li>Bake for 17 to 19 minutes, or until the top in lightly browned. Cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes. Transfer scones to the wire rack to cool, and 
                cut into wedges. Serve warm, or cool completely and store in airtight container.</li>
        </ol>
